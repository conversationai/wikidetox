Second, the article that I gave above, [EXTERNA_LINK: http://www.springerlink.com/content/y485230u8147111r/], uses a much more complicated root finding algorithm than binary search. First, the \"event function\" (the d(x,y) distance function) is interpolated using a polynomial. This is done by augmenting the ODE of the system by adjoining differential equations for the distance functions. Then the RK integrator gives a dense output, consisting of a polynomial which interpolates the true solution (including the event function) over the time interval. Third, the roots of this polynomial over the time interval are found using Sturm sequences (I do something similar, but I use the [WIKI_LINK: Durand-Kerner method] instead.) Finally, the exact zero of the distance functions are found by running a Newton-Raphson rootfinding algorithm on the (nonpolynomial) distance functions, and using the roots found by the Sturm sequence algorithm as initial guesses. The overall algorithm is compared to LSODAR, which is a black-box numerical integrator that includes event handling. By comparison, LSODAR apparently uses a variant of the secant method and bisection method, as does MATLAB's ODE suite (see [WIKI_LINK: Brent's method].) The black-box algorithms can sometimes be faster, but part of the point of the Grabner paper is that the interpolation method more reliably catches the first event in a time interval. Apparently, they found that for 25+ spheres, LSODAR works 20-30% slower than their algorithm.", "timestamp": "2007-06-19 18:05:05 UTC", "status": "just added", "page_title": "Talk:Collision detection", "user_text": "Loisel", "parent_id": "139239659.4319.4319"}, "139251101.5453.5453": {"id": "139251101.5453.5453", "comment_type": "COMMENT_ADDING", "content": " Well you certainly used a lot of names there but that really doesn't help.

According to [WIKI_LINK: Guy Sebastian]'s wiki bio his father Ivan is of Sri Lankan descent, while his mother Nellie has an English and Portuguese background.  He has a distinctive signature soul voice and grew up listening to [WIKI_LINK: Otis Redding] and [WIKI_LINK: Al Green] and these were major influences along with [WIKI_LINK: Stevie Wonder]. Church was a big part of his formative years and he honed his style and vocals singing gospel music in church every week.  What is 'white' these days anyway - there are lots of people in this modern world who come from a blended heritage. Sebastian is Caucasian, has green eyes and is not black.  There are also artists on this page that have a blended heritage as well. I am not sure what else I need to do here - I have provided a third party citation to support Sebastian's inclusion on the list of Australian blue-eyed soul artists and also provided an image of him with blue-eyed soul artist Mr [WIKI_LINK: Steve Cropper] touring in Australia together in early 2008.  Sebastian just recently moved to the United States and is again teaming up with Cropper in Philadelphia [EXTERNAL_LINK: World Cafe.

The 2006 table there is pretty standard, so it's a good template to use - the only unusual thing is that usually all the sources are listed at the bottom of the page rather than the bottom of the table. As SA has no Coalition your job will be much easier, as you won't need to worry about having (Lib) and (Nat) after every Coalition candidate. (Still a big one, but these are among my personal favourites to make.) There's a lot of patience involved, too. Step one is to decide on title headers. I'd say for SA the only ones you'd need at this stage are ALP, Lib, Greens and Family First - there's no one else we can guarantee will run in a sufficient number of seats to earn a column to themselves (except maybe the Democrats). Looking at 2006, the Democrats should at least move further to the right of the table, as the Greens and Family First are definitely more important to the election. Then it's on with the show. I personally find it easier to type the tables rather than the back-spacing, but that's a personal preference. I also tend to have a linked party name on the clipboard (i.e. copy and paste), but if you're doing the backspacing thing that's not so important.

My work (in many ways, life) has been sitting across from flesh and blood people trying to help them untangle the emotional knots they have found themselves in. There I'm comfortable because it's familiar to me. It's taking me longer to be comfortable sitting across from a machine that is essentially 1s & 0s. I am comfortable with the information within Wikipedia, where my task is to extract that information and, in my own way, I hope improve on it. I saw that message regarding Wiki e-mail & wondered what it was wanting me to do & why. The wetter my feet get at this, the more comfortable I feel with the structure, the more I will be able to contribute to the content. Right now I'm still learning. Hope we can connect again.

Take, for instance, the case of Y-DNA [WIKI_LINK: Haplogroup C (Y-DNA)@Haplogroup C]: one subclade of Haplogroup C, namely [WIKI_LINK: Haplogroup C3 (Y-DNA)@Haplogroup C3], is the modal Y-chromosome haplogroup among [WIKI_LINK: Mongols]; the overwhelming majority of mtDNA sequences among the Mongols belong to subclades of [WIKI_LINK: Haplogroup M (mtDNA)@Haplogroup M]. Another subclade of Haplogroup C, namely Haplogroup C4, is the modal Y-chromosome haplogroup among [WIKI_LINK: indigenous Australians]. However, close to 100% of indigenous Australian mtDNA haplotypes belong to various Australian-specific subclades of [WIKI_LINK: Haplogroup N (mtDNA)@Haplogroup N]. So, in the case of the Mongols, Y-DNA Haplogroup C is correlated strongly with mtDNA Haplogroup M, but in the case of the Australian aborigines, Y-DNA Haplogroup C is correlated even more strongly with mtDNA Haplogroup N. We cannot draw unfounded associations between particular Y-DNA and mtDNA haplogroups at the present level of phylogenetic resolution. I would bring up the case of Y-DNA [WIKI_LINK: Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)@Haplogroup R1b1c] as a case in point: it has recently been discovered that a great percentage of the Haplogroup R1b1c Y-chromosomes found among the [WIKI_LINK: Basque people] belong to either of two primarily Basque-specific subclades, R1b1c4 or R1b1c6. The majority of R1b1c Y-chromosomes found among other modern Western European populations are much more closely related to Haplogroup R1b1c9 Y-chromosomes that appear to derive from the ancestral population of the [WIKI_LINK: German people] or to Haplogroup R1b1c7 Y-chromosomes that are common among the [WIKI_LINK: Irish people] and [WIKI_LINK: Scottish people]. The crux of the matter is that every subclade has its own history. You need to respect this fact and defer composition of a table of associations between various Y-DNA and mtDNA haplogroups to a future time when the human Y-chromosome and mitochondrial DNA phylogeny has been determined to a sufficient degree of resolution.", "timestamp": "2007-01-20 05:49:29 UTC", "status": "just added", "page_title": "User talk:HalfOfElement29", "user_text": "Ebizur", "parent_id": "101950497.10.10"}, "101953012.886.886": {"id": "101953012.886.886", "comment_type": "COMMENT_ADDING", "content": " If you could not tell, I am already well aware of the difficulties in matching y-haplogroups and mt-haplogroups.

In other words, Wiki prefers to cite an authoritative _published_ source, rather than things like \"personal communication\".  All this inspires me to think about publishing something on it, so that Wiki will have a source to refer to. His letter was written in what I as a professor would call \"B-minus\" Spanish.  In quoting from it, I will give my English translation.  The source was indeed the (fictional) Italian slogan from \"The Barefoot Contessa\", as stated in the Wiki article.  \"My colleague, Mr. Livingston, was very impressed with the film and noted this phrase as a possible song title; only he [!] translated [it] into Spanish because this language seemed better for a hit song.\"  When they were assigned to write a song for \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\", Hitchcock suggested it be a song with a title in a foreign language, and of a sort that a mother might sing to her child.  \"We immediately [thought of] the title 'Que Ser\u00e1 Ser\u00e1' and wrote the song that won us an Oscar....\" For what it's worth, he consistently puts an accent on \"Ser\u00e1\" but not on \"Que\".  The sheet-music cover that I've seen on line has the title in ALL-CAPS  which, for many typesetters in Spanish, makes accent marks optional. The Wiki article is correct in saying that \"Qu\u00e9 ser\u00e1 ser\u00e1\" is ungrammatical in Spanish, at least as an expression of \"what will be will be\".  Native-speakers have told me they hear the line as the question \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 ser\u00e1?\" (\"What will it be?\" or \"What's gonna happen?\"), with the verb simply echoed to fit the music (compare \"Mary had a little lamb, little lamb,...\").", "timestamp": "2010-04-22 15:40:10 UTC", "status": "content changed", "page_title": "Talk:Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)", "user_text": "Kotabatubara", "parent_id": "357505060.6833.6833"}}

If it continues in the vein I have seen, I will likley seek to have you barred from further participation on the article. Here are some notes on things you could do to improve your editing. 1. You need to seek consensus for changes that may be controvercial, as opposed to merely making those changes and hoping that they are either missed or that they are protected by the 1rr probation the article is under. There are a number of ways you could do this - you could propose your changes on the talk page and then wait for many comments, specifically looking for comments from people that have problems with your edits, correcting the problems they have, and then resoliciting their opinion. Another option is to make the changes you would like to the article, but expressly state that any editor may revert them, or that you would revert them on demand. 2. Blogs are never acceptable sources. If the only source you can find for something is a blog, it should never be included in an article. If you are sure something is true - it's not. You need a source for all information you intend to put in the article. 3. You should \"write for the enemy\" - when you are making an edit, be sure you know what the response from people who are traditionally on the other side of the debate from you would think of it, and make specific consessions to what problems you would expect them to have with it. 4. Edit summaries should be accurate. If you are reverting, note that. If you are making multiple changes, don't just mention one change and hope the rest go under the radar.

So I speak of \"Creationism\" (a belief system, held by many contributory people) and \"The Creation Science Movement\" (an American political movement to represent Creationism as a science, to evade a Supreme Court ruling that prohibits teaching any religion in public schools). The former is a belief system, the latter is criminal and fraudulent (although honest people participate in it without personally intending fraud; just as there are honest people in pyramid schemes). So even I can be a PITA in the pseudoscience area, but what I construe to be a pernicious political motivation (by some) is no reason to rebuff honest questions, critiques, and the clarification of honest confusions. Also, historically, some dubious science has led to some real science. An honest exploration from flawed hypotheses can still be good science.

Also, the \"Jimbo Wales\" thing is just a joke; most of it is inside the \"vandalism\" section on the userpage.  It is sort-of an inside joke: In the past I've seen people put the line \"Can I really edit here?\" and Jimbo Wales's signature.  I don't know how often this is still practiced.  So I decided to mock this practice over the years by putting it in the limelight and repeating it as an obvious joke in a non-serious section of the userpage.  For example, I would not forge anyone's signature in this talk page.  Where it is in a serious section of my userpage, it is identified as a quote.  In some cases I use it in a fake dialog where the fake \"Jimbo Wales\" keeps repeating the line and I respond to it  it's not meant to be a \"forgery\".  So you can edit the \"vandalism\" section of the userpage if you like to remove it, or let me know if doing that in the first place is considered a violation. Let me know if I need to do anything differently or if anything I'm doing is a violation of the rules.", "timestamp": "2011-05-02 17:44:47 UTC", "status": "just added", "page_title": "User talk:Wykypydya", "user_text": "Wykypydya", "parent_id": "427100484.12286.12286"}, "427185572.12932.12932": {"id": "427185572.12932.12932", "comment_type": "COMMENT_ADDING", "content": " :This isn't really about a violation of rules.

Attempts to revert the NPOV tag are inherently unreasonable, because the attempt itself demonstrates the  existence of a dispute and therefore justifies insertion of the tag. One cannot logically deny the existence of a dispute and at the same time participate in one. In addition, an important  purpose of the NPOV tag is to avoid edit wars: \"By linking to this page from an article, a dissenter can register his or her concern without unduly upsetting the author(s) or maintainer(s) of the article, and without starting a flame war. Others would maintain, however, that linking to this page only postpones the dispute. This might be a good thing, though, if a \"cooling off\" period seems required.\" Permitting edit warriors to remove the NPOV tag by applying the 3RR rule to attempts to insert the NPOV tag is inconsistent with this purpose. Also, since the NPOV tag may refer to disputes regarding different parts of the text, multiple inserts of the tag do not necessarily have equivalent meaning.

In case we haven't seen enough strategies ... I'm hoping this one synthesizes many of the ideas, values and approaches that different people have brought to the project  plus make good use of the multitude of Wikipedians. Essentially, I'm thinking we could set up something roughly like [WIKI_LINK: WP:FAC]. People would nominate articles or lists for inclusion. The community would consider each entry's quality and relative importance, and the community would decide whether to include the entry in the release version. And for subsequent release versions, the community would also decide whether an entry should be removed or replaced. To guard against deterioration, at least the date of the qualification should probably be recorded. We would set an eligibilty threshold, which would gradually lower. Possible thresholds include FA, FL, GA, core topics, countries. And then when we get enough entries, we proceed to publish. I'm biased, but I'm excited about this. :You know, Maurreen, I'm surprised we didn't think of this earlier!  I think it sounds like an excellent idea, well done! We will be contacting all the WikiProjects again soon, should we say, \"Which articles in your subject area should be on the CD?\" I think I would like to decide on a publication DATE, since people are used to the idea that WP1.0 is at some point indefinitely in the future, perhaps years away.  If we said that we wanted to catch the Christmas market by having a cutoff for entries by (say) Friday, September 1, 2006, I think people would focus their attention on it more.  We would have ask them to nominate a specific version of each article, too, and perhaps ask them to update it if necessary right before the cutoff date.  Your criteria sound excellent, though I would add another, namely \"importance.\"  Our first release is likely to be 2000 or so, so we don't have room for fancruft and the like - though I think bigger releases should include some fancruft and roadcruft if the quality is there. ::Thank you.

I think we would look silly if (for example) we had [WIKI_LINK: Starfleet ranks and insignia] (a former FAC) included but we didn't include [WIKI_LINK: Science fiction].  Despite that, my dream is to see a WP release that includes both.  I agree that importance (like \"notability\") is in the eye of the beholder, but I think we will be in a better position to judge that once we have contacted the WikiProjects a second time to get their lists of most important topics, and we have put together some trees to go beneath the [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia:Version 1.0 Editorial Team/Core topics/Tree@core topics tree].  I do think a deadline is a good thing, because we are going to need a cutoff point to go to press anyway.  If we have 2000 articles together and organised - sure, we can wait a week and get 2050 articles, but that will growth never end.  We should have a proposed cutoff date, and once we have everything organised for publication and we are just adding more articles we can make that date (or a later one) a firm date.

Considering some of the grammar mistakes in chapter titles, and the occasional mismatch between the German chapter titles and the Japanese chpater titles, the mangaka is obviously not very proficient in German and is most likely simply pulling words out of a dictionary. So the bottom line is, the manga is called \u00dcbel Blatt in German (or maybe \u00dcbelBlatt since the mangaka failed to put any space between the words), the Japanese transliteration is IMHO irrelevant for determining the English transliteration since the title is given as both German and Japanese on the tankoubon cover", "timestamp": "2009-12-29 07:16:14 UTC", "status": "just added", "page_title": "Talk:\u00dcbel Blatt", "user_text": "77.220.100.185", "parent_id": "329630543.1777.1777"}}

If Hanuman Das would agree to remove the contemporary words of Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, would you agree to remove the references to Sivaya Subramuniyaswami. The reason I suggest this is to make the site respectable to those who simply want to know the most scholarly impartial sources. For instance if you check Brytanica it does not quote contemporary gurus. This winds up looking like (even if it isn't) plugs for various masters and gives the appearance of NPOV. Traditional sources from the traditions, such as the The Kularnava Tantra (XIV/65) already quoted in the article are great. And we can give various root traditions under headings  Buddhist, Vedantic, etc. I know this will hurt, but it needn't. You can still put all the quotes you like on the Sivaya Subramuniyaswami and help you defend and improve that site. This is all fact as this is the beliefs of this guru and his followers, so its POV can't be chanllenged. Then when you mention the word \"satguru\" or Sat Guru as you have it, it will link to a reputable article grounded in tradition and will not appear to be a circular contrivance of followers of Sivaya Subramuniyaswami. So it actually increases his credibility founded in ancient traditions and not self-generated. Do you see? Please let me know soon. I do not want to see happen to this site what has happened to some guru sites  all the arguments over POV that you and others have suffered. So I implore you. Let me know and then I will talk also to Hanuman Das and Baba Louis about this compromise.

Please email me at chrisott1@cox.net and explain what is going on. I have also asked Hanuman to email me as he does not want to discuss this on his page. What I would like is an agreement to desist from quoting contemporary satgus on the page for satgurus. This should be confined to their pages. This should not drift over into sub-sites that are scholarly works on vedantic traditional terms. Scholars want to know the source of the traditions and terms, not about current debates over what he said and she said among all the modern gurus. It would be better that the site for satguru be short than a place of contention over contemporary living sources. This will help all concerned by making the references to satguru more respectable and clear of quarrels. Until recently no such problems existed on that entry.

They end up being three goofy animals. The labrador is obnoxious and yet very crazy, the cat is somewhat intellegent and calm, and the wolf is addicted to anything edible or drinkable and is screwed up in the head. Boskov hates his experiments. To humiliate them, he names the labrador, Sillybonkers, and controls his mind so he keeps that name. He calls the cat, Wackno. And the wolf, Ajax. Then he tries to kill them. However, they escape and must find their place in the world. The first 10 episodes focus on them living in the Big Apple (New York City), and then to upstate New York, like in the woods. They occasionally move more around the states on episodes 19 to 30. After season one, they go worldwide. I think episode 51 (season 2 premiere) will have them in somewhere in the UK. Sound exciting?

Why would an article include every instance of a band's recorded audio career and neglect to include a pertinent instance of a band's audio/visual career? - Perhaps a performance on letterman or leno goes unreferenced, this I understand.  But a one-hour feature concert exclusive, the only thing of its kind in that band's ouevre deserves to be referenced no more or less then every example from a band's discography.  In fact, I would make the case that an appearance on a show like Beautiful Noise is more interesting and important then most of the discography's included in entirety on many, many artist pages. You write \"Bands appear on TV shows all the time, after all\" - really?  How many full length concert series are on TV? Besides Austin City Limits and Live at Abbey Road I don't think there is another concert series currently in production.  Again, if you are referring to one-off song performances on variety shows, awards shows, etc...then I would agree with you.  In this case, I don't believe you know what the show is and I feel you were quick to jump the gun with the \"unreferenced trivia\" edit.  In fact, it's not trivia or spam - it's a reference to an important accomplishment in a band's career. You are, of course, entitled to disagree with me, as I am with you. BTW - I too have a history degree.  And I can assure you that all historians would agree that audio/visual references are as important as audio references, especially when it comes to music.

Biased editing, even if defended aggressively, is in itself not trolling. By themselves, misguided nominations, votes, and proposed policy are not trolling. They are only trolling when they are motivated by a program of malice rather than ignorance or bias. This requires a judgment of the personal motivation for another's action. Such a judgment can never be made with anything approaching certainty. This fact should always be kept in mind when one is tempted to label someone a troll. Pay note, carefully!

For information, here is the section that IP Address keeps trying to insert: *The specific region Norse-Gaels settled in [WIKI_LINK: Northern England] was once all of one piece and after the [WIKI_LINK: Norman Conquest] called [WIKI_LINK: Richmondshire], the land which was composed of the Irish Sea's coast from the [WIKI_LINK: River Ribble] (although some went to [WIKI_LINK: Cheshire]) and throughout [WIKI_LINK: Cumbria] into the [WIKI_LINK: Yorkshire Dales].

Although the Norwegian element is undisputed, the Celtic side is more [WIKI_LINK: Brythonic] by tradition and continues to be an English subculture throughout the region.  What he calls the \"[WIKI_LINK: Quaker]\" [WIKI_LINK: North Midlands] is discussed at depth in [WIKI_LINK: David Hackett Fischer]'s Albion's Seed, heavily overlapping the \"[WIKI_LINK: Scotch-Irish]\" cultural area of [WIKI_LINK: North Britain] for all intents and purposes.  Professor Fischer expounds upon the Norse surnames and villages of the Quakers (e.g. [WIKI_LINK: Margaret Fell]) who were poor dalesmen and lived in compact, stone-built homes (much as in Ireland and the Scottish Western Isles across the water).  [EXTERNAL_LINK: Quaker historian Hugh Barbour] believes there were innate differences between the locals and their Norman overlords for many centuries, that the commoners were [WIKI_LINK: Evangelical] while their landlords were [WIKI_LINK: Recusant].  Barbour maintains that the Norman system of feudal manors was always resented, compared to the preferred Norse method of \"[WIKI_LINK: moot]s\".  These people wore a style of clothing called \"hodden grey\" and [WIKI_LINK: Shepherd@they raised sheep], contibuting much to the industrial development throughout the North of England. Eh?

The above contribution is impenetrable, poorly written, and has every appearance of being plain pants (not helped by the bizarre comments left by the writer on various Talk pages).

So, selecting older parts among the voluminous scriptures of Early Buddhism, scholars of critical approach try to elucidate the true purport of the teachings of the Buddha, or what is closest to his virtual teachings.

The wording in your version blurs the distinction between possible different meanings, & thus blurs the possible distinction between the Buddha's original teaching & later periods of PSB. * The statement that the 1st schism occurred between the 2nd & 3rd councils is false in the sense that it is not a fact in the WP sense but a theory held by most scholars, as I've stated in my version, but not all. I cite scholars who disagree or question. * The concept of PSB itself (not the term, which is a separate discussion) is questionable. Schopen questions the idea that there was ever a period of unified Buddhism before it split into schools. He suggests (I don't think he's positively asserting) that Buddhism started out very diverse, & then gradually coalesced into a limited number of schools. I agree he's not entirely clear, but that's no justification for censoring his views. Of course my additions confuse things. That's the whole point.

Therefore it is appropriate that they be discussed in depth. This includes the reasons why cults may not be responsible, as well as who says that they are. The media attention given to this hypothesis alone makes it worthy of inclusion in a significant section. 4) Cults have also been shown to have committed large animal mutilations in Europe for decades, but not in the US, it is therefore important to discuss the similarities and differences of these cases. Particularly as it impacts significantly on public opinion (again, as 'animal mutilation' redirects to 'cattle mutilation' this seems an appropriate place to highlight the issue). 5) This page deals with both natural and unnatural mutilations (Predators, perverts and UFOs). It is therefore important that natural and unnatural be given equal weight, and that distinctions be drawn where they exist (eg horse ripping V horse/cattle mutilation and human mutilation V Muti killing). 6) Unmarked helicopters and aircraft were clearly associated with cattle mutilation by witness statements given to the FBI, and are therefore a viable part of mutilation folklore/fact.

You left the section about Lady the horse in. as well as the foreword about sheep and horese being mutilated, so it must be relevent that other animals suffer the same thing. 2) How, exactly, do you suggest that I verify something that is part of an unexplained phenomena? The best that I can do is to find proof that people believe that there are links and then show the reasons why they believe this. Can you verify that they are not linked to CM? 3) The PP were near identical to the cattle mutilations, except not with cattle. There's a trace link right there. 4) The best way to solve undue weight is not for you to delete the section, it is for you to ADD weight to the other side of the argument. Create, don't destroy. The anti-cult arguments are all valid. If you feel that it is out of balance, then YOU need to ADD some pro-cult.

Your explanation for this dubious tag, such as it was, was in your edit summary. I have two requests of you. First, could you please stop solely providing explanations for controversial edits in your edit summaries?  This practice is an unnecessary trigger to edit-warring, as someone who disagrees with you is going to be tempted to respond with an edit summary of their own, saying so  and that will require them reverting you.  Really, reading the discussion of editorial issues should not require a reader to look at both the article's talk page  and the article's contribution history, to see the edit summaries.  Reconciling which edit summaries were responses to which substantive comments in the talk page is an unnecessary burden.  If the explanation for the edit is more than a phrase, or a link to a policy page or previous discussion, it really belongs on the talk page, not in the edit summary.  If the edit or explanation is controversial, the explanation really belongs on the talk page. I am sorry the documentation for the  tag isn't clearer.  When instantiated the dubious tag provides two links.  The second link \"discuss\", will take the reader to where the tag placer has initiated a discussion of whatever they consider dubious.  So, if you had put {{dubious|Guilt by association?}}, when instantiated clicking on the \"discuss\" link would try to take the reader to [WIKI_LINK: Talk:Sajeel Shahid#Guilt by association?].  Of course you would also have the responsibility to have created a subsection entitled \"Guilt by association?\"  but you should already have done that  rather than follow a practice that is a trigger to edit-warring. I request you try your best to avoid leaving edit summaries that could serve to trigger edit warring, in so far as you are able.  I request that when you use the  tag, you use it in a manner where the \"discuss\" link takes the reader to an actual discussion of your concern. Thanks! Yours for more collegial collaboration...

The St.Helens canal referred to, is actually the St.Helens Branch, an extra length of canal built some eighteen years after the Sankey Canal first opened, joining St.Helens to the Sankey Canal. The Ordnance Survey may refer to the St.Helens canal on their maps due to assumption, caused by their reference to personally opinionated writings, like Wikipedia has become. You, yourself, only know what you have read, and that is 'St.Helens Canal', and so do a lot of other people, worldwide. Until the true facts are shown, people all over the world, who know no better, will all believe the wrong information. The same thing happens with much more important matters than the name of a canal, due to people believing what they read, without question. I disagree strongly with your comment ... \"It is more important to be verifiable than it is to be correct\".  Also, American English is gramatically different to English, so please refrain from correcting script which is only wrong by opinion. Please take a look at a site by some local enthusiasts, the 'Sankey Canal Restoration Society', [EXTERNA_LINK: http://www.scars.org.uk]  Some of the things they say on there are, again, not true fact but are very close.

Permission was granted and was titled the Sankey Navigation Act. On it's opening, the name was changed to Sankey Canal as it was constructed alongside the Sankey Brook instead of along the same course. These facts are historically recorded. I can appreciate your belief in the O.S. but, unfortunately, they are WRONG in this case. You see, people will always believe what they read, thinking it is fact. The Sankey Canal is claimed to be the first canal in Britain on many sites, however it was not. The Bridgewater Canal is also claimed to be the first canal in Britain, again it is not. But people believe these things, simply because they are repeatedly given the same, wrong, information. Wikipedia is FULL of false facts and cannot be taken seriously.

I have pointed out numerous times that I am willing to engage in compromise  I have even made a number of compromises on my own, leaving in some questionable criticism in places, for example.  FeloniousMonk wrote that on my RfC that he certified that he had tried and failed to resolve a dispute with me  however he has only left two brief comments on my talk page.

Why are you having such trouble understanding this? After a manual advocating assasination that he was responsible for (because he was the head of the progam) surfaced, there was a scandal or 'flap' about it. Thus, he needed help from North, who was also involved in Contra affairs, to help him secure a job at the NSC. This was the same year that Congressional support for the Contras ended, and the same year that Pres. Reagan moved the Contra program from the CIA (where it was now illegal) to the NSC (where it wasn't). Thus, the program was moved, and Cannistraro was made director of intelligence at the NSC, meaning that he was running at least the intelligence side of the Contra operation from the NSC. Hence the quote about him coordinating inter-agency meetings. This is what these quotes say. Anything more or less is to misunderstand their relevance.

So I began by adding a few subheadings (before they were added, was almost impossible to read).  A few days later, somebody then added the following tag to the article:  \"This article may need to be wikified to meet Wikipedia's quality standards\" etc. etc.\" Can you state, in plain English, what that means?  I tried to look it up but find the Wiki help pages rather... ummm... well, let's say circumlocutious. I also have a few questions about the original tagging.  As I said, it is officially \"tagged\" as an article that needs cleanup work.  How does this happen?  What does it mean?  What does one need to do to get it \"back on track\"?  Whom does one need to contact to have it reviewed?  And why is there no indexing aside from \"pages needing cleanup\" etc.?

There is no trademark \"Matchbox Toys\".  (As opposed to some of their competitors' names, such as Dinky Toys, which is  as two'' words  a trademark.)  Thus I feel it is factually incorrect to have the article under the name \"Matchbox Toys\". How does one go about solving a situation like this?

Sources below) gave the sith order detailed background.  It recounted how the Sith order was a Manichean partner to the Jedi order that had fought many battles with it in ages prior to the rise of the first Galactic Empire. Several thousand years before the battle of Yavin, the order took it's final form with exactly two members at any time, master and apprentice, both titled \"Darth\". The final two were Senator/Emperor Palpatine, Darth Sidious and Darth Vader, AKA Anakin Skywalker. The Sith use negative emotions such as anger, confusion, and fear to achieve mastery of their victims and advance the Dark Side. In the Revenge of the Sith there are two scenes in which the final Sith are revealed as having turned to the dark side. The first occurs when Palpatine tells Anakin that Sith teachings can save Padme from the death he, Anakin, has foreseen in childbirth. Anakin recognizes him then as a Sith and draws his light saber. The second scene is when Darth Vader confronts Obi Wan in their duel on Mustafar and he says to Obi Wan that all the Jedi are corrupt. Obi Wan says that \"only a Sith deals in absolutes\" and recognizes Anakin as one and draws his light saber.

At that time, there was a list or table of countries, indicating their English usage and the expectation was that articles concerning the country would use that English: American or British.  I believe Cuba, Mexico, maybe South American countries were shown as using American English, but I don't remember.  I have no idea where that list went to now, but it seemed reasonable to me then and now as a necessary compromise.  What I now can see when looking at various category trees is that where there is a British/American spelling difference, only the US categories get the American English (maybe grudgingly at that) while all the other countries get British English.  This may not be done so much by British English pushers as is done by those pushing WP name uniformity to override any and all other concerns to have names match the local English in use.  Except for the US itself, the uniformity argument nearly always winsthere is really no standing or acceptance for the local argument.  There is also the case that when we get to the international level, then it is a majority count.  With all of Europe and all the former British colonies and really all countries but the US, then at the international level categories, the choice is always British.  Now if this were a British WP, all of this would not be problem, but this is supposed to be an English WP.  The consequence may be (absolutely no way to demonstrate this) is that American English readers will be turned off and then tune out.  For better or for worse, many people like things that are familiar to them; other things, not familiar, are more suspect, foreign, not 'us' but 'them'.  If my suggested consequence is true, the current situation and direction is surely not a good thing for WP, with some Americans just dropping out.  Another example of where this relentless uniformity logic goes, trying to override all that is local can be found at [WIKI_LINK: Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (geographic names)#RFC: United States cities], where is seems non-US editors are trying to impose their views (and show their lack of knowledge) on a US local situation.

The UK's colonial hand has been much longer than the U.S.'s through history, so it's natural that more places will accept UK English over American English.

As you say plenty of first team regulars have matches with the reserves and until now I wouldn't have thought that they had left the first team (especially if they have played only a few matches for the reserves). Maybe we should ask at [WIKI_LINK: WP:FOOTY] if adding matches for reserve teams generally gives a wrong impression. As I understand it, the infobox should list all the apps and goals for the domestic league. This means for me for German domestic leagues the top three levels (which are professional). For some players the third level is the highest they ever play, so I think we agree that if a player was mainly playing for the reserves, matches should be counted.

Had it been zinc chloride catalysing a thoroughly unexceptional reaction, like (say) the Friedel-Crafts ethylation of an activated benzene with EtCl / ZnCl2, then I would not have added it.  However, what I added offers an example of alkylation (which was not there) and an unusual building of a carbon skeleton.

In this perspective, mountains, if they exist at all, are just the roofline of an orogen. In my mind, these authors are distancing orogeny from mountains. Mountains are there, but they are incidental. Then there is the quote from [EXTERNAL_LINK: PB King] (apparently a stellar authority) in this account, and on the legend of the Tectonic Map of North America, \u201corogeny\u201d is therefore used for the processes by which the rock structures within the mountain chains or fold belts are created. This statement appears to require the presence of mountains, but orogeny refers to aspects of events surrounding the formation of rock structures in these mountains, not to the formation of the mountains per se. This statement is very close to the one by [EXTERNAL_LINK: Jackson & Bates]: By present geological usage, orogeny is the process by which structures within fold-belt mountainous areas were formed, including thrusting, folding, and faulting in the outer and higher layers, and plastic folding, metamorphism, and plutonism in the inner and deeper layers. This statement refers to rock-forming processes in mountainous areas, (and way, way beneath them) not to mountain building per se, and goes on to point out that: the deformation of rocks within the mountains, and the creation of the mountainous topography ... were mostly not closely related, either in origin or in time. So I have a spectrum of opinion ranging from a reference almost to plate tectonics itself onward to what is instead a catalog of possible processes that form rock structures. All statements distance orogeny from mountain building per se. I also find myself in my own reading that the usage of orogeny in the long detailed descriptions of specific orogens like [WIKI_LINK: Caledonian orogeny], [WIKI_LINK: Antler orogeny] & so forth agree with the above statements as to subject better than than they agree with the etymology of orogen.

They claim this based on the fact that the Zionist State has 6 million Jews of whom only 600,000 are Chareidim. From that they deduct that 5,4 million are Zionists. WRONG.

If that is allowed to take place then I will stop pressing the issue.

Sol is commonly used in literature and other popular media as a name for our particular sun, usually in science fiction where it is often necessary to avoid confusion with other stars.  (The name Luna is likewise often used as another name for the Moon.)  Perhaps the statement is simply referring to the name of the Sun as it is known within the fictional astronomy of the Doctor Who universe.

I'm not exactly sure of an answer but do you know if your moth has a tongue? If so then the only food it will eat is the nectar from a flower, like a butterfly. I'm not exactly sure of flower species, but [WIKI_LINK: Honey suckle] will probably do. But your moth may not have any mouth at all and as a result, have no need to eat. This type of moth only lives for one week and lives only to reproduce. But, I do know one thing for sure, once the moth has fully matured, you need to release it right away. It will have an instinct to find the food it eats (if it does eat), and it will need to reproduce.

I note with interest that the treatment page does not include the treatement that I have found most effective in long-term suppression of this condition, namely medical-grade aqueous cream (not regular aqueous cream which contains perfumes and is not sterile) mixed with a small amount of cortizone (about a 1 in 10 ratio). As my dermatologist explained it, SD is the result of the skin drying out and the dry skin cracks and the rashes and other symptoms that appear are actually secondary infections (not really the SD at all). During an acute attack one first uses antibiotics to clear up the secondary infections, then uses the aqueous cream with a small amount of cortizone to keep the skin moisturised and speed the healing of minor lesions to prevent secondary infections. Since I have been using this treatment for the better part of 5 years to successfuly treat this condition I am inclined to agree with my dermatologist's assessment. The other benefit of this treatment is that the doses of cortizon are extremely low and topical, and thus no long-term problems.

I stumbled across the American Dragon category while looking at an article that was in it, pulled it up and thought it looked very much like a number of other categories that have been deleted, thought that it was unnecessary as a navigational hub and thought that it would attract more articles on actors and crew if it remained. I guess my global rationale, such as it is, is that in my experience the vast majority of categories named for stuff like individual people, films or TV shows are not needed. Most of the categories named for people, especially those in the arts, hold the article on the person and the subcats for albums and songs. TV show and film categories tend to hold subcats for episodes and characters and the article for the show or film. All of this stuff is easily interlinked through the show's article and slapping it into a category strikes me as completely pointless, categorization for the sake of categorizing. Same goes for family categories. All that's in most of them are the articles on the individual family members. I'm a big believer in streamlining and having hundreds of categories that IMHO serve no purpose is not streamlined. Simplest is usually best and many of these category trees aren't simple and they aren't particularly functional. I don't spend a lot of time going out and looking for these things; it has just happened, as I mentioned previously, that in fairly short order I've found several similar trees and have been working through them.

I.e., I just removed dozens of links to an Arthur C.

However, it's not his bizarre inconsistencies and idiosyncratic views that trouble me. It's the fact that he acts upon these idiosyncratic views with no concern for other editors, alternatively using blunt personal attacks, blatant dishonesty, subtle deception, and outright revert-warring to put those views into practice. Although Copperchair has claimed that he never knew what the consensus was regarding, say, the inclusion of Wedge Antilles in the credits for various Star Wars films, one of his own talk page links [11] shows that myself, A Link to the Past, and Clawson all agree Wedge should be included, which at least provides a rough consensus. The fact that Copperchair's attempts to add Wedge have been reverted, at various times, by just about all parties listed as \"Party 2\" in this RfAr and then some also demonstrates a consensus. As for Copperchair's assertions that \"we should follow the filmmakers\u2019 decision\" and that, in that respect, \"consensus is irrelevant\", Copperchair is demonstrating a severe disagreement with the policy of Consensus.

Except what I changed came directly from the report. Here's what the referenced source says: \"In 1982, a phase II study with 175 patients looked at which types of cancer might benefit from treatment with amygdalin. Most of the patients in this study had breast, colon, or lung cancer. Amygdalin was given by injection for 21 days, followed by oral maintenance therapy using doses and procedures similar to those in the phase I study. Vitamins and pancreatic enzymes were also given as part of a metabolic therapy program that also included dietary changes. One stomach cancer patient showed a decrease in tumor size, which was maintained for 10 weeks while the patient was on amygdalin therapy. In about half of the patients, cancer had grown at the end of the treatment. Cancer had grown in all patients 7 months after completing treatment. Some patients reported an improvement in their ability to work or do other activities, and other patients said their symptoms improved. These improvements, however, did not last after treatment ended.\" This is what I wrote: \"A 1982 study found that while on Amygdalin therapy patients symptoms improved, though once taken off therapy the improvements didn't last. One patient's tumor decreased in size, and the rest either had no size change or increased.\" This is what's written: \"A 1982 trial of 178 patients found that tumor size had increased in all patients. Minimal side effects were seen except in two patients who consumed bitter almonds and suffered from cyanide poisoning.\" > Notice that the patients who consumed bitter almonds and had cyanide poisoning are not at all mentioned in the source. Perhaps it would be better to write: \"A 1982 trial of 175 patients found that while undergoing vitamin therapy and amygdalin injections, an improvement in symptoms was reported by some patients, while others reported that their ability to work or do other activities had improved. While on the therapy, one patients tumor mass decreased and approximately half had tumors increased in size. Seven months after therapy ended however, all patients tumors were found to have grown, and previous improvements reported did not last.\" My feeling on that is, (though not to be written in the article), isn't obvious that after treatment stops the disease will continue to grow? It seems it's less a indicator of the effectiveness of treatment but rather of the non-effectiveness of lack of treatment.

You removed the following for the reason \"It is utter garbarge\":Quantum evolution is the hypothesis that genetic mutation is adaptive, or directed through quantum effects.I quote from the back cover of the book \"Quantum Evolution - Life in the Multiverse\" by Johnjoe McFadden (a leading theorist in this area, and Professor at Surrey University - i.e. someone who knows more about this than you): : \"Living organisms are controlled by a single molecule - DNA. Yet Physics tells us that the behaviour of single molecules is controlled not by classical laws but by quantum mechanics. The implications of this for biology have never been fully explored. Until now. In this brilliant debut, Johnjoe McFadden puts forward a startling new theory of quantum evolution. He shows how quantum mechanics gives living organisms the ability to initiate specific actions including new mutations. Thus evolution may not be random at all but directed - cells may, in certain circumstances, be able to choose to mutate particular genes that provide an advantage in the environment in which the cell finds itself. This property of living organisms to direct their actions has startling implications. It must be at the root of both consciousness and free will: Quantum Evolution provides a new understanding of the origin of life and the meaning of death. Life, this brilliant book argues, is a quantum phenomenon.

The math wars really got into gear about the mid 1990s, and even the NCTM has backpedaled since 2000, culminating in the latest headlines which made nearly front page news on both the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. NCTM research and curriculum frameworks based on the 1989 standards are cited by nations around the world, including Korea, Australia and New Zealand. The biggest impact and one of the biggest sources of controversy over mathematics instruction is the elevation of topics and methods that were once completely outside the scope of mathematics instruction, such as diversity, writing, cutting, pasting, coloring and even singing (the teacher's manual to Investigations even comes with sheet music to Happy Birthday). Texts such as Investigations and Mathland do not even include formal direct instruction of many of the skills listed as being mathematics topics.  If you are not familiar with the extent of the controversy, I would suggest taking a quick look at Mathematically Correct and some of their reviews. Standards based texts generally get glowing reviews from promoters of  the standards, but reviews from consumers are rarely as positive, and often negative. If discussion of the controversy were restricted to education journals, then it might certainly be relegated to footnote background articles, but when it makes the front page of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, and the policy of the most influential mathematics education standards organization in the United States, and therefore, the world, it is certainly  not a local issue. An issue which is essentially the only mathematics issue that gets front page coverage in contemporary newspapers certainly justifies similar coverage on the main wikipedia mathematics education article. Edits have been mode both expanding on the principles and motivation of standards based mathematics, as well as its critics. The influence of the 1989 standards is such that it remains the foundation of nearly every state curriculum framework, with states like California which have all but openly rejected those standards, and news stories of individual districts backing out or openly discarding standards-based curriculum showing a clear start of a movement away from the standards, even though  today they remain predominant in the US and in many other nations.  To only present the point of view of mathematics educators would be seriously unbalanced, as they are uniformly committed to the 1989 standards and are against a return to traditional teaching methods.
